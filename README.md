# 🦙 Llama 2 Blog Generator (Offline, 7B GGML) with Streamlit

## Project Overview
Imagine being able to generate entire blog articles without relying on external servers or APIs. That's exactly what this project delivers.
Using the powerful **Llama 2 7B GGML** model locally, and crafting a thoughtful prompt template, this application generates full-fledged blog posts—right from your machine.
An interactive **Streamlit** interface ties everything together, making the experience intuitive and accessible.

## Features
- 📄 Custom-designed **Prompt Engineering** to guide blog generation effectively.
- 🖥️ **Offline Inference** with the Llama 2 7B GGML model, ensuring speed and privacy.
- 🚀 A responsive **Streamlit Web Application** for a smooth user experience.
- ⚡ No internet needed during generation — fast, reliable, and completely local.

## Tech Stack
- **Llama 2 7B GGML (offline model)**
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Streamlit for the UI**
- **Prompt Engineering principles**

## How It Works
First, the user inputs a simple topic or keyword inside the Streamlit app.  
Then, behind the scenes, a crafted prompt template reshapes this input into a form that Llama 2 can expand creatively.
The model generates a coherent, detailed blog post in response—sometimes poetic, sometimes sharp—depending on the prompt!
Finally, the text output is displayed immediately on the Streamlit page for review, editing, or use.

## Setup Instructions
